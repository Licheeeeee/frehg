# frehg
Frehg stands for Fine Resolution Environmental Hydrodynamic and Groundwater model. It is a coupled 2D depth-integrated hydrodynamic and 3D variably-saturated groundwater model.

Currently the Frehg model is still under development. As of 2020-08, Frehg is able to model coupled surface-subsurface flow over complex topography. Future development plan includes enabling simulation of scalar transport and subgrid-scale topographic effects.

The hydrodynamic part of Frehg is built based on:<br />

The variably-saturated groundwater part of Frehg is built based on:<br />
