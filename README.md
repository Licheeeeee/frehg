# frehg
Frehg stands for Fine Resolution Environmental Hydrodynamic and Groundwater model. A 3D variably-saturated groundwater solver is added to the FrehdC model to enable simulation of surface-subsurface interaction. 

Currently the Frehg model is still under development. The subsurface part of the model has not been completely coded and tested.
