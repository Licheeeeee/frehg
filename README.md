# frehg
Frehg stands for Fine Resolution Environmental Hydrodynamic and Groundwater model. It is a coupled 2D depth-integrated hydrodynamic and 3D variably-saturated groundwater model.

Currently the Frehg model is still under development. As of 2020-10, Frehg is able to model coupled surface-subsurface flow over complex topography. Future development plan includes enabling simulation of scalar transport and subgrid-scale topographic effects.

The hydrodynamic part of Frehg is built based on:<br />
    Li, Z., Hodges, B.R. Model instability and channel connectivity for 2D coastal marsh simulations. Environ Fluid Mech 19, 1309â€“1338 (2019) doi:10.1007/s10652-018-9623-7 <br />
    Li, Z., Hodges, B.R. Modeling subgrid-scale topographic effects on shallow marsh hydrodynamics and salinity transport. Adv. Water Resour 129, 1-15 (2019) doi:10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.05.004 <br />

The variably-saturated groundwater part of Frehg is built based on:<br />
    Li, Z., Ozgen, I. and Maina, F.Z., (2020), A mass-conservative predictor-corrector solution to the 1D Richards equation with adaptive time control, Journal of Hydrology, under review <br />
    
The following figure validates the frehg model against benchmark problems used by Sulis(2010). The black, red and blue curves are surface runoff of the saturated excess and the infiltration excess examples. The frehg model produces similar results with the CATHY and ParFlow models, with minor deviations likely due to unspecified initial water content in Sulis(2010).

A user manual of frehg should be available in the near future (hopefully...)
